# brunocrypt.sh

Encrypts and decrypts `.env` files in a recursive directory structure.

## Encryption

Place your secrets in the `.env` files in your bruno repository.
Run `./brunocrypt.sh --encrypt ~/path/to/your/repository/ --recipient your@mail.com` for encrypting the `.env` files using your email as recipient.
The script will use your gpg key to encrypt all `.env` files in the directory tree.
The encrypted files will be placed right beside the `.env` files, and are named `.env.gpg`.
The script will add `*.gpg` to your `.gitignore` if it isn't in there already. Existing `.env.gpg` files are overwritten.

## Decryption

Run `./brunocrypt.sh --decrypt ~/path/to/your/repository/` for decrypting all `.env.gpg` files in this directory tree. The decrypted `.env` files are placed right beside the encrypted files and will overwrite existing `.env` files.

## Clean

Run `./brunocrypt.sh --clean ~/path/to/your/repository/` to cleanup decrypted `.env` files.
The script will list all `.env` files in the directory structure and ask you if you really want to delete them. Run this command with the `-f` switch to skip the question and delete all `.env` files without asking for permission.
